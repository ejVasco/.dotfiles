# Overview
This repo contains configs and themes for a bunch of programs I use on different distro setups on my PC or server (or at least will in the future), for the purpose to streamline setup of future systems I use.

The dracula theme repo is a submodule to this repo.

To pull with repo with submodules:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ejVasco/.dotfiles.git
```
To pull submodules after cloning repo:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
```
git pull
```
The dracula submodules take a while to clone and some are individual submodule themes are not public and get skipped.

After cloning navigate into the corresponding distro repo and more information in the README.
